{comment:Intro/Interludes}   [Eb]     

{comment:Verse 1}
[Eb]Abide with me: fast f[Ab]alls the e[Bb]vent[Eb]ide;
[Eb]The darkness d[Ab]eepens; L[Fm]ord, with me ab[Bb]ide:
[Eb]When other helpers f[Ab]ail, and [Cm]comforts f[Bb]lee,
[Bb]Help of the h[Eb]elpless, O a[Eb]bide w[Bb]ith [Eb]me.

{comment:Verse 2}
[Eb]Swift to its close ebbs o[Ab]ut life's l[Bb]ittle [Eb]day;
[Eb]Earth's joys grow d[Ab]im, its gl[Fm]ories pass a[Bb]way,
[Eb]Change and decay in [Ab]all ar[Cm]ound I [Bb]see;
[Bb]O Thou who c[Eb]hangest not, a[Eb]bide w[Bb]ith [Eb]me.

{comment:Verse 3}
[Eb]I need Thy presence e[Ab]very p[Bb]assing h[Eb]our;
[Eb]What but Thy g[Ab]race can f[Fm]oil the tempter's p[Bb]ower?
[Eb]Who, like Thyself, my g[Ab]uide and [Cm]stay can [Bb]be?
[Bb]Through cloud and [Eb]sunshine, Lord, a[Eb]bide [Bb]with [Eb]me.

{comment:Verse 4}
[Eb]I fear no foe, with T[Ab]hee at [Bb]hand to b[Eb]less:
[Eb]Ills have no w[Ab]eight, and [Fm]tears no bitter[Bb]ness.
[Eb]Where is death's sting? where, g[Ab]rave, thy v[Cm]icto[Bb]ry?
[Bb]I triumph s[Eb]till, if Thou a[Eb]bide w[Bb]ith [Eb]me.

{comment:Verse 5}
[Eb]Hold Thou Thy Cross be[Ab]fore my cl[Bb]osing e[Eb]yes:
[Eb]Shine through the g[Ab]loom, and [Fm]point me to the s[Bb]kies:
[Eb]Heaven's morning breaks, and e[Ab]arth's vain s[Cm]hadows f[Bb]lee:
[Bb]In life, in [Eb]death, O Lord, a[Eb]bide w[Bb]ith [Eb]me.
