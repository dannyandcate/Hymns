{comment:Verse 1}
Here is l [G]ove vast as the [C]ocean
Loving k[G]indness as the [D/F#]flood When the [G]Prince of Life, our[C] Ransom, Shed for[G] us His pr[D]ecious[G] blood
Who His [G]love will not re[D/F#]member Who can [Am]cease to sing His [G]praise He will[Em] never be for[C]gotten Throughout[G] Heav'n's [D]eternal[G] days 
{comment:Verse 2}
On the [G]mount of crucif[C]ixion
Fountains [G]opened deep and w[D/F#]ide
Through the [G]floodgates of God's [C]mercy Flowed a[G] vast and[D] gracious[G] tide Grace and[G] love like mighty[D/F#] rivers Poured[Am] incessant from [G]above
Heav'n's [Em]peace and perfect ju[C]stice Kissed a[G] guilty wo[D]rld in [G]love

{comment:Verse 3}
Let me [G]all Thy love acc[C]epting, Love [G]Thee ever all my [D/F#]days
Let m[G]e seek Thy kingdom o[C]nly
And my [G]life be [D]to Thy [G]praise;
Thou a[G]lone shalt be my [D/F#]glory,
Nothing [Am]in this world I [G]see;
Thou hast [Em]cleansed and sancti[C]fied me
Thou [G]Thyself hast [D]set me f[G]ree.
