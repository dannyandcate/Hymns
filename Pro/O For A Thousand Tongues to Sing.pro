{comment:Verse 1}
O [G]for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer’s p[D/F#]raise,
The g[G]lories of my [Em]God and King,
The [C]triumphs of His g[G]race.

{comment:Verse 2}
My [G]gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proc[D/F#]laim,
To s[G]pread through all the [Em]earth abroad
The [C]honors of Thy n[G]ame.

{comment:Verse 3}
He [G]breaks the power of canceled sin,
He sets the prisoner [D/F#]free;
His [G]blood can make the f[Em]oulest clean,
His [C]blood availed for [G]me.

{comment:Verse 4}
He [G]speaks, and, listening to His voice,
New life the dead [D/F#]receive,
The [G]mournful, broken h[Em]earts rejoice,
The [C]humble poor be[G]lieve.

{comment:Verse 5}
Je[G]sus, the Name that charms our fears
That bids our sorrows c[D/F#]ease;
'Tis [G]music in the [Em]sinner's ears,
'Tis [C]life, and health, and p[G]eace.

{comment:Verse 6}
See a[G]ll your sins on Jesus laid
The Lamb of God was s[D/F#]lain,
His [G]soul was once an [Em]offering made
For [C]every soul in [G]pain.

{comment:Verse 7}
Gl[G]ory to God, and praise and love
Be ever, ever g[D/F#]iven,
By s[G]aints below and s[Em]aints above,
The [C]church in earth and [G]heaven.

{comment:Verse 1}
O fo[G]r a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer’s [D/F#]praise,
The g[G]lories of my [Em]God and King,
The [C]triumphs of His [G]grace.
