[Eb] [Ab] [Eb] [Bb] [Eb] 

{comment:Verse 1}
The love of [Eb]God is [Ab]greater [Eb]far
Than tongue or [Bb]pen can ever [Eb]tell,
It goes be[Eb]yond the [Ab]highest [Eb]star,
And reaches [Bb]to the lowest [Eb]hell;
The guilty p[Ab]air, bowed down with c[Eb]are,
God gave His [Bb]Son to [Eb]win;       
His erring c[Ab]hild He reconc[Eb]iled,
And pardoned [Bb]from his [Eb]sin.     

{comment:Verse 2}
When mortal t[Eb]ime shall [Ab]pass a[Eb]way,
And earthly [Bb]thrones and kingdoms f[Eb]all;
When men who [Eb]here ref[Ab]use to p[Eb]ray,
On rocks and [Bb]hills and mountains c[Eb]all;
God’s love, so s[Ab]ure, shall still en[Eb]dure,
All measurel[Bb]ess and s[Eb]trong;
Redeeming g[Ab]race to Adam’s r[Eb]ace
The saints’ and a[Bb]ngels’ s[Eb]ong.

{start_of_chorus}
Oh love of [Ab]God, how rich and p[Eb]ure
How measurel[Bb]ess and s[Eb]trong   
It shall for[Ab]evermore en[Eb]dure,
The saints’ and [Bb]angels’ [Eb]song.  
{end_of_chorus} 

{comment:Verse 3}
Could we with [Eb]ink the o[Ab]cean f[Eb]ill,
And were the s[Bb]kies of parchment [Eb]made,
Were every s[Eb]talk on e[Ab]arth a q[Eb]uill
And every [Bb]man a scribe by t[Eb]rade;
To write the l[Ab]ove of God a[Eb]bove
Would drain the o[Bb]cean [Eb]dry;
Nor could the s[Ab]croll contain the [Eb]whole,
Tho' stretched from [Bb]sky to [Eb]sky.
