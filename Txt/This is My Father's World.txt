{comment:Verse 1}
This [Bb]is my [F]Father’s [Bb]world,
And [Eb]to my [Bb]list’ning [F]ears
All [Bb]nature [F]sings, and r[Gm]ound me rings
The [Bb]music [F]of the s[Bb]pheres.
This [Bb]is my [Eb]Father’[Bb]s world:
I [Eb]rest me[F] in the[Bb] thought
Of [Bb]rocks and[F] trees, of[Gm] skies and seas
His[Bb] hand the[F] wonders [Bb]wrought.

{comment:Verse 2}
This [Bb]is my [F]Father’s[Bb] world:
The [Eb]birds the[Bb]ir carols[F] raise,
The [Bb]morning[F] light, the [Gm]lily white,
Declar[Bb]e their[F] Maker’s [Bb]praise.
This [Bb]is my [Eb]Father’s [Bb]world:
He [Eb]shines [F]in all that’[Bb]s fair;
In the [Bb]rustling[F] grass I[Gm] hear Him pass,
He [Bb]speaks to[F] me every[Bb]where.

{comment:Verse 3}
This[Bb] is my[F] Father’s[Bb] world:
Oh, [Eb]let me [Bb]ne’er for[F]get
That [Bb]though the [F]wrong seems [Gm]oft so strong,
God i[Bb]s the[F] ruler[Bb] yet.
This [Bb]is my[Eb] Father’s [Bb]world,
The [Eb]battle[F] is no[Bb]t done:
Jesus[Bb] who die[F]d shall be sa[Gm]tisfied,
And[Bb] earth and[F] Heav’n be[Bb] one
