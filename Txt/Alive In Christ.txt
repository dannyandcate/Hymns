[Em] [D] [C] 

{comment:Verse 1}                                 
We were d[Em]ead in [D]our sins[C], 
As we [Em]followed [D]our own [C]path
We were [Em]turning [D]from Him[C],
Living [Em]like we [D]had no [C]home
But be[C]cause of His great [D]love for us;

{comment:Chorus}
We are a[G]live in Christ         
No longer [Em]dead in [D]sin
Jesus has [G]paid the price
And by His [Em]grace we [D]live

{comment:Tag}
[C]We are made [D]alive in Jesus Christ

{comment:Verse 2}
Incom[Em]para[D]ble grace[C] 
Is the [Em]kindness [D]of our [C]Christ
By His [Em]hands we [D]are saved[C] 
So we [Em]boast not [D]in our[C]selves
But be[C]cause of His great [D]love for us;

{comment:Chorus}
