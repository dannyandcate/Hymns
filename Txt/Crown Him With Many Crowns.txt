{comment:Verse 1}  
[Eb]Crown him with many [Ab]crowns,
The [Eb]Lamb upon his [Bb]throne;
Hark! [Eb]how the heavenly [F]anthem drowns                          
All Bb]music but its own.
Aw[Eb]ake, my soul, and [Ab]sing 
Of [F]him who died for [Bb]thee, 
And ha[Eb]il him as thy m[Ab]atchless king
Through [Ab]all et[Bb]erni[Eb]ty.

{comment:Verse 2}
[Eb]Crown him the Lord of [Ab]life
Who [Eb]triumphed o'er the g[Bb]rave,
And r[Eb]ose victorious [F]in the strife           
For [Bb]those he came to save;
His gl[Eb]ories now we [Ab]sing
Who [F]died, and rose on [Bb]high.
Who d[Eb]ied, eternal [Ab]life to bring
And [Ab]lives that [Bb]death may d[Eb]ie.

{comment:Verse 3}
[Eb]Crown him the Lord of [Ab]love,
Beh[Eb]old his hands and [Bb]side,
Rich w[Eb]ounds, yet v[F]isible above,
In b[Bb]eauty glorified:
To t[Eb]hee be endless [Ab]praise
For T[F]hou for us hast [Bb]died
Be T[Eb]hou O Lord thru e[Ab]ndless days
Ad[Ab]ored and M[Bb]agnifi[Eb]ed

{comment:Verse 4}
[Eb]Crown him the Lord of [Ab]heaven,
One [Eb]with the Father [Bb]known.
And [Eb]the blest Spirit, t[F]hrough him given
From y[Bb]onder triune throne
All [Eb]hail! Redeemer, [Ab]Hail!
For T[F]hou hast died for [Bb]me;
Thy [Eb]praise shall never, n[Ab]ever fail
Throug[Ab]hout et[Bb]ernit[Eb]y!
