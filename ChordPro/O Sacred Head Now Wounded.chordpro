{comment:Verse 1}
O [F]sacred head, now [G]wound[C]ed,
With g[Am]rief and s[E]hame weighed d[Am]own.
Now s[F]cornfully su[G]rrou[C]nded
With t[Am]horns, Thine [E]only cr[Am]own.
O s[G]acred [F]head, what g[C]lory,
What b[F]liss till now was T[Am]hine.
Yet, t[G]hough des[C]pised and g[D]ory,
I j[F]oy to c[G]all Thee m[Am]ine.

{comment:Verse 2}
What T[F]hou, my Lord, hast [G]suffe[C]red,
Was [Am]all for s[E]inners' [Am]gain.
Mine, [F]mine was the trans[G]gres[C]sion,
But T[Am]hine the d[E]eadly p[Am]ain.
Lo, [G]here I f[F]all, my S[C]avior
'Tis [F]I deserve Thy p[Am]lace;
Look [G]on me [C]with Thy [D]favo[G]r,
and g[F]rant to [G]me thy g[Am]race.

{comment:Verse 3}
What [F]language shall I [G]borr[C]ow
to t[Am]hank thee, d[E]earest Fr[Am]iend,
for t[F]his, thy dying [G]sorro[C]w,
thy [Am]pity wi[E]thout [Am]end.
Oh, m[G]ake me t[F]hine for[C]ever,
and [F]should I fainting [Am]be,
Lord, [G]let me [C]never, n[D]ever
outl[F]ive my l[G]ove to t[Am]hee.

{comment:Verse 4}
The j[F]oy can never be [G]spok[C]en,
Ab[Am]ove all j[E]oys bes[Am]ide,
When [F]in Thy body [G]bro[C]ken
I t[Am]hus with s[E]afety [Am]hide.
O [G]Lord of L[F]ife, des[C]iring
Thy g[F]lory now to s[Am]ee,
Be[G]side Thy c[C]ross ex[D]pir[G]ing,
Iâ€™d b[F]reathe my [G]soul to T[Am]hee.
