{comment:Verse 1}
Ben[D]eath the cross of Jesus
I [A]fain would take my st[D]and.
The s[Bm]hadow of a [G]mighty rock
Wi[Em]thin a [D]weary [D/F#]land.
A h[D]ome within the wilderness,
A r[G]est upon the way.
From the b[A]urning of the no[D]ontide heat
And b[D]urdens [A]of the d[D]ay.

{comment:Verse 2}
U[D]pon the cross of Jesus,
Mine e[A]yes at times can s[D]ee
The [Bm]very dying f[G]orm of One
Who su[Em]ffered t[D]here for [D/F#]me.
And f[D]rom my stricken heart with tears
Two w[G]onders I confess,
The w[A]onders of red[D]eeming love
And [D]my unw[A]orthin[D]ess.

{comment:Verse 3}
I [D]take, O cross, thy shadow
For [A]my abiding p[D]lace.
I [Bm]ask no other s[G]unshine than
The [Em]sunshine [D]of His [D/F#]face.
Con[D]tent to let the world go by
To [G]know no gain nor loss.
My s[A]inful self my o[D]nly shame,
My g[D]lory [A]all the c[D]ross.
