{comment:Verse 1}
I [G]need Thee every hour most g[C]racious Lord. 
No [Em]tender voice like Thine can p[D]eace afford.â€¨
{start_of_chorus}
I [G]need thee, oh I [D/F#]need thee, every hour I n[G]eed Thee
Oh [Em]bless me now my S[C]avior I c[D]ome to T[G]hee.
{end_of_chorus}

{comment:Verse 2}
I [G]need Thee every hour, stay T[C]hou nearby;
Temp[Em]tations lose their power when T[D]hou art nigh.

{comment:Verse 3}
I n[G]eed Thee every hour, in j[C]oy or pain;
Come q[Em]uickly and abide, or l[D]ife is vain.

{comment:Verse 4}
I [G]need Thee every hour, teach [C]me Thy will;
And [Em]Thy rich promises In [D]me fulfill.
