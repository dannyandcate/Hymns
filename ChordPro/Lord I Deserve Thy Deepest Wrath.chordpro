{comment:Verse 1}
Lord, I [A#m]deserve Thy deepest [G#]wrath,
ungrateful, [F#]faithless I have been;
no terrors [A#m]have my soul dete[G#]rred,
nor goodness w[F#]ooed me from my sin.
My heart i[A#m]s vile, my mind depr[G#]aved,
my flesh r[F#]ebels against Thy will;
I am po[A#m]lluted in Thy si[G#]ght,
yet, Lord, have m[F#]ercy on me still

{start_of_chorus}
Have mercy [A#m]on me[G#]
Have mercy [F#]on me still
Have mercy [A#m]on me[G#]
Have mercy [F#]on me still
{end_of_chorus}

{comment:Verse 2}
Without [A#m]defense to Thee I l[G#]ook,
to Thee the o[F#]nly Savior fly;
without a [A#m]hope, without a frie[G#]nd,
in deep dist[F#]ress to Thee I cry.
Speak peace to [A#m]me, my sins fo[G#]rgive,
dwell Thou withi[F#]n my heart, O God;
the guilt and [A#m]pow'r of sin re[G#]move,
and fit me f[F#]or Thy blest abode.
