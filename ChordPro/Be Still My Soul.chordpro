{comment:Verse 1}
Be still my [C]soul, the [D]Lord is on your s[G]ide        
Bear patient[C]ly the cr[D]oss of grief or p[G]ain
Leave to your [Em]God to o[D]rder and prov[C]ide          
In every [G]change he f[C]aithful will re[D]main
Be still my s[Em]oul, your [D]best, your h[C]eavenly friend   
Through thorny w[G]ays leads [C]to a j[D]oyful end

{comment:Verse 2}
Be still my [C]soul, your [D]God will undert[G]ake
To guide the f[C]uture [D]as he has the p[G]ast
Your hope, your c[Em]onfid[D]ence let nothing s[C]hake         
All now mys[G]terious s[C]hall be bright at [D/F#]last
Be still my s[Em]oul, the w[D]aves and winds still k[C]now              
His voice who [G]ruled them [C]while he d[D]welt below

{comment:Verse 3}
Be still my s[C]oul, when d[D]earest friends de[G]part
And all is d[C]arkened [D]in the vale of t[G]ears
Then shall you [Em]better k[D]now his love, his h[C]eart         
Who comes to s[G]oothe your s[C]orrow and your [D/F#]fears
Be still my [Em]soul, your J[D]esus can re[C]pay              
From his own f[G]ullness a[C]ll he t[D]akes away 

{comment:Verse 4}
Be still my s[C]oul, the h[D]our is hast'ning o[G]n  
When we shall [C]be for[D]ever with the L[G]ord
When disa[Em]ppointment, g[D]rief, and fear are g[C]one          
Sorrow f[G]orgot, love's p[C]urest joys r[D/F#]estored
Be still my [Em]soul, when c[D]hange and tears are [C]past             
All safe and b[G]lessed [C]we shall [D]meet at last
