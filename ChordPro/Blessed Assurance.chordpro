{comment:Verse 1}
Blessed as[D]surance, J[G]esus is [D]mine.
O what a f[Bm]oretaste of glory [A]divine.
Heir of sal[D]vation, [A]purchase of[D] God,
Born of His S[G]pirit, w[A]ashed in His b[D]lood.

{start_of_chorus}
This is my s[D]tory, t[G]his is my s[D]ong,
Praising my S[G]avior all the day l[A]ong.
This is my s[D]tory, t[G]his is my s[D]ong,
Praising my S[G]avior a[A]ll the day l[D]ong.

{comment:Verse 2}
Perfect sub[D]mission, [G]all is at [D]rest;
I in my S[Bm]avior am happy and b[A]lest,
Watching and w[D]aiting, l[A]ooking [D]above,
Filled with His g[G]oodness, l[A]ost in His l[D]ove.
