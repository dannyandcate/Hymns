[F]Tis so sweet to t[Bb]rust in Jesus;

[Dm]And to [Bb]know, "Thus s[C]aith the L[F]ord."

J[F]esus, Jesus, h[C]ow I trust Him!
Ho[Dm]w I've proved Him [C]o'er and o'er.
Jes[F]us, Jesus, pr[Bb]ecious Jesus,
O[Dm] for g[Bb]race to [C]trust Him [F]more.
{end_of_chorus}

{comment:Verse 2}
[F]O how sweet to t[Bb]rust in Jesus;
[Dm]Just to trust His cl[C]eansing blood,
[F]And in simple fa[Bb]ith to plunge me
[Dm]'neath the [Bb]healing, cl[C]eansing fl[F]ood.

{comment:Verse 3}
[F]Yes, 'tis sweet to t[Bb]rust in Jesus;
[Dm]Just from sin and [C]self to cease,
[F]Just from Jesus s[Bb]imply taking
[Dm]Life and r[Bb]est, and j[C]oy and p[F]eace.
