Â [E]   [A]   [C#m]    [B]

{comment:Verse 1}
Day by d[E]ay and with each passing m[A]oment
Strength I f[B]ind to meet my trials h[E]ere;
Trusting[C#m] in my Father's wise best[A]owment,
I've no c[B]ause for worry or for f[E]ear.
He's whose h[E]eart is kind beyond all m[A]easure
Gives un[B]to each day what He deems b[E]est-
Lovin[C#m]gly, its part of pain and p[A]leasure,
Mingling t[B]oil with peace and r[E]est.
 
{comment:Verse 2}
Every[E]day the Lord Himself is n[A]ear me
With a s[B]pecial mercy for each h[E]our;
All my [C#m]cares he gladly bears and c[A]heers me,
He whose n[B]ame is Counselor and P[E]ower
The pro[E]tection of His child and t[A]reasure
Is a [B]charge that on Himself He l[E]aid;
"As thy [C#m]days, your strength shall be in m[A]easure,"
This the p[B]ledge to me he has m[E]ade.

{comment:Verse 3}
Help me [E]then in every tribul[A]ation
So to t[B]rust your promises, O L[E]ord,
That I [C#m]lose not faith's sweet consol[A]ation
Offered [B]me within your holy W[E]ord.
Help me L[E]ord, when toil and trouble m[A]eeting,
E'er to [B]take, as from a father's h[E]and,
One by [C#m]one, the day, the moments fl[A]eeting,
'Til [B]I reach the promised la[E]nd.
