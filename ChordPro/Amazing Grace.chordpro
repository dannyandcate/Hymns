A[F]mazing Grace, how s[Bb]weet the s[F]ound,
That [F]saved a wretch like [C/E]me.
I [F]once was lost but [Bb]now am foun[F]d,
Was [F]blind, but [C/E]now I s[F]ee.

{comment:Verse 2}
T'was [F]Grace that taught my h[Bb]eart to [F]fear.
And [F]Grace, my fears rel[C/E]ieved.
How p[F]recious did that [Bb]Grace ap[F]pear
The h[F]our I f[C/E]irst bel[F]ieved.

{comment:Verse 3}
Through m[F]any dangers, [Bb]toils and [F]snares,
I h[F]ave already c[C/E]ome;
â€™Tis g[F]race hath [Bb]brought me [F]safe thus far,
And g[F]race will [C/E]lead me [F]home.

{comment:Verse 4}
The [F]Lord has promised g[Bb]ood to [F]me,
His W[F]ord my hope se[C/E]cures;
He w[F]ill my Shield and P[Bb]ortion [F]be,
As l[F]ong as [C/E]life end[F]ures.
