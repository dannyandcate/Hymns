{comment:Verse 1}
O to be [G]like Thee, b[C]lessed Re[G]deemer,
This is my [G]constant lo[(A)]nging and [D]prayer.
Gladly I’ll f[G]orfeit a[C]ll of earth’s [G]treasures
Jesus, Thy [D]perfect l[A]ikeness to [D]wear.

{start_of_chorus}
O to be l[C]ike Thee, O to be [G]like Thee,
Blessed [D/F#]Redeemer, [C]pure as Thou [G]art.
Come in Thy [C]sweetness, come in Thy f[G]ullness,
Stamp Thine own i[G]mage d[D]eep on my h[G]eart.
{end_of_chorus}

{comment:Verse 2}
O to be l[G]ike Thee, [C]full of comp[G]assion,
Loving, [G]forgiving, [(A)]tender and [D]kind,
Helping the [G]helpless, c[C]heering the fa[G]inting,
Seeking the w[D]and’ring s[A]inner to f[D]ind.

{comment:Verse 3}
O to be li[G]ke Thee, l[C]owly in [G]spirit,
Holy and [G]harmless, pa[A]tient and [D]brave,
Meekly en[G]during c[C]ruel repr[G]oaches,
Willing to [D]suffer, o[A]thers to s[D]ave.
