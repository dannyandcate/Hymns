Now [Eb]thank we [Ab]all our [Bb]God,
with [Cm]heart and [Ab]hands and[Bb] voice[Eb]s,
Who[Eb] wondrous [Ab]things has [Bb]done,
in [Cm]whom His [Ab]world re[Bb]joices[Eb];
Who [Cm]from our [Eb]mothersâ€™ [Bb]arms
has [Eb]blesse  on our [Bb]way
With [Ab]countless gifts of [Fm]love,
and [Fm]still is [Bb]ours t[Eb]oday.

{comment:Verse 2}
O [Eb]may this [Ab]bounteous [Bb]God
through [Cm]all our [Ab]life be [Bb]near [Eb]us,
With [Eb]ever jo[Ab]yful [Bb]hearts
and [Cm]blessed [Ab]peace to [Bb]cheer[Eb] us;
And [Cm]keep us [Eb]in His g[Bb]race,
and g[Eb]uide us [Cm]when per[Bb]plexed;
And f[Ab]ree us from all i[Fm]lls,
Of [Fm]this worl[Bb]d in the ne[Eb]xt!

All [Eb]praise and [Ab]thanks to [Bb]God
the [Cm]Father [Ab]now be[Bb] give[Eb]n;
The[Eb] Son and [Ab]spirit b[Bb]lessed
Who [Cm]reign in [Ab]highest [Bb]Heave[Eb]n;
The [Cm]one et[Eb]ernal [Bb]God,
whom [Eb]Heaven and [Cm]Earth a[Bb]dore;
For t[Ab]hus it was, is [Fm]now,
and [Fm]shall [Bb]be ever[Eb]more.
