{comment:Verse 1}
I s[G]tand amazed in the presence
Of J[D]esus the Naza[G]rene.
And w[C]onder how He could l[G]ove me,
A s[G]inner, cond[D]emned, unc[G]lean.

{start_of_chorus}
H[G]ow marvelous, How wonderful
A[D]nd my song shall ever be:
H[G]ow marvelous, [Em]How wonderful
[Am]Is my S[G]avior's l[D]ove for [G]me.
{end_of_chorus}

{comment:Verse 2}
For [G]me it was in the garden,
He p[D]rayed, Not my will, but t[G]hine.
He [C]had no tears for his own g[G]riefs,
But s[G]weat drops of b[D]lood for [G]mine.

{comment:Verse 3}
He t[G]ook my sins and my sorrows;
He m[D]ade them His very o[G]wn.
He b[C]ore the burden to C[G]alvary,
And s[G]uffered and d[D]ied al[G]one.

{comment:Verse 4}
When [G]with the ransomed in glory,
His f[D]ace I at last shall s[G]ee.
â€™Twill b[C]e my joy through the [G]ages
To s[G]ing of His l[D]ove for [G]me.
